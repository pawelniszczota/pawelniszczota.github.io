I am an Assistant Professor at the Poznań University of Economics and Business, and the head of the [**Humans & AI Laboratory (HAI Lab)**](https://hai.ue.poznan.pl).

My research currently focuses mainly on [**large language models**](llm.html), but I also have many papers on [**sin stocks**](sinstocks).
